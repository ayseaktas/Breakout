# Breakout
A Breakout Game

This game is made on HTML Canvas and used VanillaJS, HTML, CSS. This was my school project and done couple months ago. The challange was remade a classic game without using a game engine by this means i learned a lot about game development fundamentals.

The game has 9 levels and increasing difficulty each level. It is classic "Break all the bricks and level up" mechanic. Anyone can just download and play it through browser(chrome recomended) and have benefit from source code.

Here is some of image from interface;
